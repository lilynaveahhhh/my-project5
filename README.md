# 🛒 Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown (JavaScript DOM Manipulation)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **web-based product list** that can be dynamically filtered based on the user's selection from a dropdown menu.  
The filtering happens **in real time using JavaScript DOM manipulation**, without reloading the page.  

It’s a simple yet powerful way to practice **event handling, DOM updates, and array filtering** in JavaScript.
